# Expanding File Share Capacity
{: #expandCapacity}

With this feature, current users of {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full}} are able to expand the size of their {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} in GB increments up to 12 TB immediately. They don't need to create a duplicate or manually migrate data to a larger volume.
{: shortdesc}

Billing for the volume is automatically updated to add the prorated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. Then, the full new amount is billed in the next billing cycle.

The upgrade process is not instantaneous. You can expect to see the updated size in the UI or through the API in a short while after you put in the modification request. Resizing does not cause any outage or loss of access to the storage, so you can continue your operations as normal while you wait.

## Advantages of Expandable Storage
{: #advantagesofresizing}

- **Cost management** â€“ You might know of a potential for growth of your data, but you need a smaller amount of storage to start. The ability to expand allows customers to save on the costs of storage at the start and then grow to accommodate their needs.

- **Growing Storage needs** - Customers who experience rapid growth beyond need a way to quickly and easily increase the size of their storage to manage that growth.

## Effects of expanding storage capacity on Replication
{: #effectonreplica}

Expand action on the primary storage results in automatic resizing of the replica.

## Limitations
{: #limitsofextension}

This feature is available for storage that is provisioned in [data centers](/docs/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-selectDC) with enhanced capabilities. Encrypted storage that is provisioned in these data centers can be increased to up to 12 TB.

Existing size limitations for {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}} that was provisioned with Endurance still apply (up to 4 TB for 10 IOPS tier and up to 12 TB for all other tiers).

You can't change the file share to a smaller size after you expand its capacity.
{: note}

## Resizing storage in the UI
{: #resizingstepsUI}
{: ui}

1. Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console](/login){: external}. From the menu, select **Classic Infrastructure** ![Classic icon](../icons/classic.svg "Classic"). Click **Storage** > **{{site.data.keyword.filestorage_short}}**.
2. Select the volume from the list and click the ellipsis ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Modify File Share**.
3. Enter the new storage size in GB.
4. Review your selection and the new pricing. Click **Modify**.
5. Your new storage allocation is available in a few minutes.

Unmount, then mount the modified volume, so the OS can recognize the extra storage space.

## Resizing storage with the API
{: #resizingstepsAPI}
{: api}

You can increase your storage capacity by using an API call to the SOAP web service. The following sample API calls can be called from the scripting language of your choice.

For more information about the SLAPI, see the [SLDN](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/softlayerapi){: external}.

## Resizing storage with Terraform
{: #resizingstepsTerraform}
{: terraform}

You can increase your storage capacity by using the `ibm_storage_file` resource, and specifying a different number in the capacity argument. The following example increases the capacity of an Endurance volume to 40 GB.

```terraform
resource "ibm_storage_file" "fs_endurance" {
  type       = "Endurance"
  datacenter = "dal09"
  capacity   = 40
  iops       = 0.25
}
```
{: codeblock}

The following example increases the capacity of a Performance volume to 40 GB.

```terraform
resource "ibm_storage_file" "fs_performance" {
  type       = "Performance"
  datacenter = "dal09"
  capacity   = 40
  iops       = 100
}
```
{: codeblock}

For more information about the arguments and attributes, see [ibm_storage_file](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs/resources/storage_file){: external}.

Unmount, then mount the modified volume, so the OS can recognize the extra storage space.
{: tip}


## Expanding Storage over 12 TB
{: #increasecapacityover12TB}
{: help}
{: support}

If you need to increase your Storage volume capacity beyond 12 TB, you can request to be added to the allowlist by submitting a [support case](/unifiedsupport/cases/add){: external}. When the request is approved by the Offering Manager, you're going to be notified through the case process. You're also going to see the option to increase your storage up to 24 TB in the console.
{: preview}

The number of operations that can be performed on the storage is limited. This limit is 180k IOPS. So if you want to provision a volume with 10 IOPS, your maximum volume size is 18 TB. If you want to provision the maximum size of 24 TB, then the maximum rate of reads and writes to the volume is 4 IOPS per GB.
